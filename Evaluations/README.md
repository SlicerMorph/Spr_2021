## Workshop Evaluations

This is the first time we are running this workshop online, and with this many attendees. Your feedback is really important for us; both for how we run the future online workshops, as well as for our funding. Please at the end of the each day, take few minutes to provide your feedback. We will review these daily and will do our best to incorporate them into the following days. 

At the end of the workshop (Day 5), there will be an overall evaluation. 

Thank your for your feedback.
