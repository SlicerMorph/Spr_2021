## Computer and software instructions 
For this course, we will be using the cloud installation of SlicerMorph (Courtesy of Microsoft Azure). As such all you need is a recent web browser and good internet connection. As a backup, we advise installing 3D Slicer and SlicerMorph extension to your laptop. [See minimum computer requirements on Slicer's official documentation.](https://slicer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/getting_started.html#system-requirements). We also suggest installing R and Rstudio locally on your computer. Both are available on the SlicerMorphCloud. 

**Good to haves:**	
*	A large external monitor (dual screen is preferred) 
*	A three-buttoned mouse. 

## Optional Tech Check-ins 
To avoid issues relating to software taking up course time, please consider attending one of the optional tech check-ins, where we will help you install the necessary software. 
1. March 2nd, 1-2p (Pacific Daylight Time)
2. March 4th, 10-11 (Pacific Daylight Time) 

If you cannot attend either of those, [instructions are here](https://github.com/SlicerMorph/Spr_2021/blob/main/TechCheckin/README.md)
