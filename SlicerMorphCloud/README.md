## SlicerMorphCloud Instructions
During the course you will be provided unique URL and passwords to access your own SlicerMorphCloud instance. You can either use a web browser (Firefox, Chrome) or a free software called TurboVNC. You can download and install TurboVNC from https://sourceforge.net/projects/turbovnc/files/2.2.6/. If you have on a slower connection, dedicated TurboVNC usually provides better experience. We suggest starting with the web browser option, but if you encounter performance issues try TurboVNC. 

**Note:** While it is the same server, addresses for web browser (starts with _http://_) and turboVNC connection (starts with something like _murat.slicermorph.org:41999_) are formatted slightly different and are not interchangable. Make sure to use the correct one for your connection option.

These cloud instances will be available through out the course 7/24 online until 3/14 midnight. They are very powerful and richly provisioned, and we encourage you to use these instead of local installation of SlicerMorph, so that we can join into your session if you encounter a problem. If you have any data you want to use after the workshop, please make sure to remove from these instance before 3/14. 

## Login in and setting it up for the first time
Paste the URL into the web browser or VNC address into TurboVNC, enter the password.

## Image quality settings
If you encounter mouse pointer lags or screen refresh issues in your web browser, you can adjust VNC connection quality settings. WAN connection setting in TurboVNC usually provides very good interactivity.

## SlicerMorphCloud Desktop
This is a very simple Linux desktop. If you right mouse click on the screen a pop-up menu shows the applications lists. There are four applications we will be using:
* Web browser (Firefox): Firefox will be the primary way to get your own data in and out of the SlicerMorphCloud instance, or download data from MorphoSource. To use your own data into SlicerMOrphCloud, first upload to cloud file service like Dropbox or Google Drive, then login to the cloud provider using the Firefox within SlicerMorph instance.
